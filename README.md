# React Challenge: Movie Search App

Create an application to search for movies using React.

**API Resource:**

- Use the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/). Register on the website to obtain your API key.

## Core Requirements:

1. **User Interface**:

   - Feature an input field for movie queries.
   - Incorporate a search button.

2. **Display Results**:

   - Showcase movies with details: title, year, and poster.
   - Adopt a responsive grid for movie display.

3. **Functionality**:
   - Ensure the search form's operability.
   - Connect with the OMDb API for movie data retrieval.

## Advanced Features (First Iteration):

- **Intelligent Searching**:

  - Prohibit consecutive identical search queries.
  - Support real-time search as users type in their queries.

- **Optimization**:
  - Utilize debounce techniques to mitigate excessive API requests during swift typing.

## How to Run the Application:

1. **Install Dependencies:**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the App:**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   **Note: Don't forget to add your OMDb API key in the appropriate place in the codebase.**
